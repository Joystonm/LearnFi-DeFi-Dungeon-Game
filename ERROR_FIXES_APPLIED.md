# ✅ Error Fixes Applied

## 🐛 **Fixed Runtime Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'x')"**

### **Root Cause**
The error occurred in `DungeonMap.jsx` because the `roomPositions` object didn't have entries for the new rooms (11-14) that were added to the game.

### **Solution Applied**

#### 1. **Added Missing Room Positions**
```javascript
const roomPositions = {
  // ... existing rooms 0-10
  11: { x: 20, y: 15 }, // Bonus room - treasure vault
  12: { x: 80, y: 15 }, // Bonus room - trading arena
  13: { x: 35, y: 8 },  // Bonus room - time chamber
  14: { x: 65, y: 8 }   // Bonus room - risk academy
};
```

#### 2. **Added Safety Checks**
```javascript
// Skip rooms without defined positions
if (!position) {
  console.warn(`No position defined for room ${roomId}`);
  return null;
}
```

#### 3. **Enhanced Connection Lines**
- Added null checks for both start and end positions
- Added proper filtering to remove null values
- Improved error handling for missing room connections

### **Result**
- ✅ No more runtime errors
- ✅ All 15 rooms now display correctly on the dungeon map
- ✅ Proper positioning for bonus rooms unlocked after final boss
- ✅ Connection lines work correctly between all rooms

## 🗑️ **Removed Footer from All Pages**

### **Changes Made**

#### **App.jsx Updates**
- ✅ Removed `Footer` import

- ✅ Kept header-only layout for all non-game pages
- ✅ Game route remains full-screen without header or footer

### **Result**
